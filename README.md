### serpent-toolchain

This repository (will) contain a collection of scripts that help to build
the toolchain required for the Serpent Game Framework.

Specifically, it is (to be) used to assist in cross-compilation **from Linux**
to various build targets.

In order to ensure all Serpent developers are on the same level of support,
we target explicit LDC/Dlang/etc versions.
